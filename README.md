# Mail-Basics
This Repository will cover the basics of Sieve (An Email Filtering Language), Mutt (An Email Client) and eventually some basics about mail servers.

Infrastructure
All isntallations/configurations/tests ocurred in debian based linux systems. 

	Ubuntu 14.04 x64 3.11.0-26-generic GNU/Linux (Tasty)

To go deep into Sieve language I recommend read more about Sieve,the RFC 5228 (RFC 3028 became obsolete) (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5228) and Dovecot Sieve Plugin in (http://wiki2.dovecot.org/Pigeonhole/Sieve).
